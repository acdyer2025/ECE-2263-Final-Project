# 4x3 Capacitive Touch Sensing USB-Enabled Keyboard Project Description 

This repository contains all the documents and files for my final project in ECE-2263 Embedded Systems in C. This is an Electrical and Computer Engineering course I took my freshman year of college. I would start by reading my formal design report found in the Design Report folder as Dyer_FinalProjectDesignReport_v1.pdf. This is a lengthy report detailing what the project is, how it works, and other useful information. That report is my final submission to the instructor for this project. It is fairly large (48 pages) so you might have to download it rather than viewing it on GitHub. 

In addition, at the start of this project we created a formal requirements document listing the requirements we expected our project to meet. This can be found in the Requirements Document folder if you wish to see how well I met my requirements.
